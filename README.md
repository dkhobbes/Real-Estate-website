# Real Estate project

This was an assignment from the first month of the Iron Yard boot camp. We were utilizing express, and ejs to create a CSV parser and put it on server on the local host. This was an assignment where I finished only the first two parts, but didn't host it on Heroku for the final part of the assignment.
